# black_adder - example aberth service app

Copyright (c) 2014 Aleksandar Radulovic

Little example to show off usage of aberth (it's that simple, yes!).

You will need [rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar) to compile.

    $ rebar get-deps compile

To run the black_adder app run the start.sh:

    $ ./start.sh

Now you can call the service with clients in Python and Ruby. You will need bertrpc packages for both (not provided here).
